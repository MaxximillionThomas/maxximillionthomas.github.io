Project Effort Estimation
What is effort estimation?
________________________________________
Effort estimation is a critical aspect of project management in software development. It involves predicting the amount of time and resources that will be required to develop a software product. This estimation is crucial for planning, allocating resources, and setting client expectations.
There are several methods for effort estimation:
1.	Expert Judgement: This is the most straightforward method. Here, an experienced person or a group of experts use their knowledge and understanding of the project to estimate the effort required. This method is quick but can be inaccurate due to biases or lack of information.
2.	Analagous Estimation: This method involves comparing the current project with similar past projects. The effort taken for the past projects is used as a baseline to estimate the effort for the current project. This method is more accurate if the past projects are very similar to the current one.
3.	Parametric Estimation: This method uses statistical modeling to estimate effort. It involves identifying the key cost drivers (parameters) of a project, such as the size of the software, and using these parameters in a mathematical model to estimate effort.ssess the feasibility of proposed solutions by analyzing technical constraints, cost implications, and potential risks. 
4.	Bottom-Up Estimation: This method involves breaking down the project into smaller tasks, estimating the effort for each task, and then adding up these estimates to get the total effort. This method is often more accurate but can be time-consuming.
5.	Three-Point Estimation: This method involves estimating three values for each task - the most optimistic estimate (if everything goes right), the most pessimistic estimate (if everything goes wrong), and the most likely estimate. These three estimates are then combined to give a final estimate.
6.	Use Case Points (UCP): This method is specific to object-oriented software development. It involves estimating the effort based on the number and complexity of the use cases in the project.
Remember, no single method is perfect for all situations. The choice of method depends on the nature of the project, the available data, and the level of accuracy required. Also, it’s important to revisit and revise the estimates as the project progresses and more information becomes available. In conclusion, effort estimation is more of an art than a science. It requires experience, judgment, and continuous learning. But with practice, you can get better at it and make your software development projects more predictable and manageable. Happy coding! 🚀
Work Breakdown Structures
What is a work breakdown structure (WBS)?
________________________________________
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a key tool used in project management, including software development projects. It’s a way to organize and break down the overall project into manageable chunks or components. Here’s a simple introduction:
•	What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)? A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. It organizes and defines the total scope of the project, and represents the work specified in the current approved project scope statement.
•	Why use a WBS in Software Development?In software development, a WBS can help in several ways: 
1.	Scope Management: It helps define what needs to be done so you can avoid scope creep (doing more than initially planned).
2.	Task Assignment: It allows tasks to be easily assigned to team members.
3.	Progress Tracking: It provides a structure for tracking progress and managing the project.
4.	Risk Identification: It can help identify risks at an early stage in the project.
5.	Resource Allocation: Projects require people, money and often physical infrastructure or other "things" to get the job done. You'll often find yourself allocating resources to specific tasks.
•	How to Create a WBS?: Here are the basic steps to create a WBS for a software development project. You can find a more detailed version of these steps in the recommended textbook: 
1.	Identify the Main Deliverables: These are the big pieces of the project. For a software project, this might include design, coding, testing, and documentation.
2.	Break Down the Deliverables: Each main deliverable is broken down into smaller tasks. For example, the coding deliverable might be broken down into tasks for coding different features.
3.	Continue Breaking Down Tasks: Keep breaking down tasks until they are small enough to be easily estimated and managed. The end result is a tree-like structure with the project at the top and individual tasks at the bottom.
•	Example of a WBS in Software Development: Here’s a simple example for a hypothetical project to develop a web app:

KANBAN
What is KANBAN?
________________________________________
Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput. Let's break it down:
1.	Visualize the Workflow: In software development, this could be as simple as “To Do”, “In Progress”, and “Done” columns. Each task or piece of work is represented as a card that moves from one column to another representing the progress of work.
2.	Limit Work in Progress (WIP): This means that you limit the amount of work that is in the “In Progress” phase. If there’s too much work in progress, it might be a sign that work is being started but not finished.
3.	Manage Flow: The team should actively be monitoring and managing the work so that it flows smoothly through the process. This could involve daily stand-ups to discuss the status of the work.
4.	Make Policies Explicit: There should be a clear understanding of what is required to move a task from one phase of the process to the next.
5.	Implement Feedback Loops: Regular meetings, such as retrospectives, should be held to discuss what’s working and what’s not, and to make improvements to the system.
6.	Improve Collaboratively: Kanban encourages small, incremental changes that stick. The entire team works together to make these improvements.
Remember, Kanban is more than just a board with columns for tasks. It’s a system that helps teams work together more effectively, and it can be a great way to manage software development projects. It allows teams to visualize their work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency(or flow). It’s all about continuous improvement, flexibility, and focus on delivering quality products to the customer.

Working in Teams - Mitigating Conflict
Mitigating Conflict
________________________________________
Conflict can arise due to various reasons such as misunderstandings, different work styles, or simply a lack of communication. Conflict has an immediately negative effect on the productivity of a team, let alone the happiness of team members. As a student, and later a professional, it is a guarantee that you will face conflict in your work. Here are some strategies to manage and mitigate conflicts:
1.	Establish Clear Communication Channels: Open and transparent communication lays the foundation for effective conflict management. It’s important to encourage open communication among team members.
2.	Promote Active Listening and Empathy: Encourage team members to understand and respect each other’s perspectives.
3.	Implement Mediation Processes: If a conflict escalates, having a neutral third party to mediate can help resolve the issue.
4.	Encourage Collaborative Problem-Solving: Disagreements can lead to better solutions when people focus on the result that’s best, instead of being “right”.
5.	Establish Constructive Feedback Mechanisms: Regular feedback sessions can help address issues before they escalate into major conflicts.
6.	Set Clear Expectations: Clearly define roles, responsibilities, and expectations to avoid misunderstandings. This also includes holding people accountable when they don't do their part.
7.	Embrace Diversity and Inclusive Decision Making: Respect for diversity and inclusive decision-making can prevent many conflicts.
8.	Lead by Example: As a leader, your behaviour sets the tone for the team. Displaying conflict resolution skills can encourage your team to do the same.
Remember, while conflict is often viewed negatively, some disputes can actually benefit group dynamics, such as discussions about how best to tackle certain problems or what tech stacks are most appropriate for different projects. However, when disruptive disagreements do arise, it’s important to address them promptly and effectively.

Teamwork and Conflict Resolution FAQ
1. What are the main causes of conflict in a team setting?
Conflict can stem from various factors, including misunderstandings, differing work styles, and poor communication. Essentially, anything that disrupts the flow of collaboration and mutual understanding can lead to conflict.
2. Why is it crucial to address conflict promptly?
Unresolved conflict negatively impacts team productivity and morale. It creates tension, reduces collaboration, and hinders progress. Addressing conflicts quickly prevents these issues from escalating and maintains a positive work environment.
3. How can open communication help in mitigating conflict?
Open communication encourages team members to express their thoughts and concerns freely. It fosters transparency and allows for early identification and resolution of potential conflicts before they escalate.
4. What role does empathy play in resolving disagreements?
Empathy involves understanding and respecting others' perspectives. When team members actively listen and try to see the situation from their colleagues' viewpoints, it becomes easier to find common ground and work towards a resolution.
5. When is mediation helpful in resolving conflict?
Mediation, involving a neutral third party, is particularly beneficial when a conflict becomes too heated or complex for the involved parties to resolve independently. A mediator helps facilitate constructive dialogue and guides the team towards a mutually acceptable solution.
6. How can constructive feedback mechanisms prevent conflicts?
Regular feedback sessions allow team members to address concerns, provide suggestions, and receive input on their performance. This open feedback loop helps identify and resolve minor issues before they develop into major conflicts.
7. What is the importance of establishing clear expectations for team members?
Clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and expectations minimize the potential for misunderstandings and disagreements. When everyone knows what is expected of them and others, it fosters accountability and reduces the likelihood of conflict arising from ambiguity.
8. Can conflict sometimes be beneficial?
While often viewed negatively, constructive conflict, such as disagreements about problem-solving approaches or project strategies, can lead to innovation and better decision-making. The key is to ensure these disagreements remain respectful and focused on finding the best solution for the team.

Tuckman's Model of Team Formation
5 Stages of Development
________________________________________
The Five Stages of Team Development, also known as Tuckman’s Theory, was developed and created by psychologist Bruce Tuckman in 1965. Tuckman stated that the teams must cover five stages of development which are: forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning (Tuckman’s Theory, 2021). An important point he considered is that the team must go over these five stages to achieve its full potential, and according to this theory, the first approach is when the group members first meet, and the last moment happens when the team finishes the project (Tuckman’s Theory, 2021).
Originally the model, Bruce Tuckman (1965) only included four stages of team development, these were Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing. However, in the late 1970s, he included a fifth stage which is adjourning. This last stage is known as mourning or termination (Business, n.d). This model explains how the team develops maturity and ability, establishes relationships among the members, and the changes of the leader when it comes to the leadership styles. The leadership style changes among the distinct stages. It begins with a directing style, then to coaching and participation and in the finishing stage, the delegation stage (Bruce Tuckman’s 1965, n.d.). Tuckman’s model is an explanation and understanding of how a team develops. As well, it helps to train people in group work enabling them to accomplish their full potential (Bruce Tuckman’s 1965, n.d.).
Overview of the Model
Tuckman’s research was related to psychotherapy and the mental health context. Taking into consideration this review, he separated the articles into three categories:
•	the ones that described therapy groups,
•	those that described human relations training or T-groups in which an intervention was designed to raise the interpersonal sensitivity and support other people to socialize fruitfully
•	those that mixed articles related to the nature of the group existence with those groups solely created to make research on topics about group phenomena (Bonebright, 2010).
In 1965, Bruce W. Tuckman released a literature publication that was reviewed-based named Development Sequence in Small Groups. The focal point of the article was on two dimensions of group development: interpersonal relationships, and task activity. Tuckman conjectured a model composed of four stages in which each stage is required to be successful to achieve the effectiveness of the group functioning (Bonebright, 2010).
Concepts
To understand Tuckman’s theory first is important to define basic concepts. The definition of a team is a key element of this theory and according to the authors, McShane, Tasa and Steen (2018) which “are groups of two or more people who interact and influence each other and are mutually accountable for achieving common goals associated with organizational objectives and perceive themselves as a social entity within an organization.”
One important element for teams is task interdependence which is the extent to which team members must share materials, information, or expertise to perform their jobs (McShane et al., 2018, p. 222). Teams develop feelings, but what are they? According to the Cambridge, Dictionary feeling as a noun is a fact of feeling something physically (Cambridge, n.d.). After developing a feeling, something occurs, and it is called behaviours which are important in having effective relationships with team members that are a key element for each stage of Tuckman’s theory. According to the New South Wales (NSW) Government behaviour is how someone acts (What is behaviour, 2020). It is what a person does to make something happen, to make something change or to keep things the same. Behaviour is a response to things that are happening and can be on two levels, internally – thoughts and feelings and/or externally – the environment, including other people. Observing behaviour is the easy part. It is understanding why someone does what they do that is much more complicated (What is behaviour, 2020).
In the storming and adjourning stage conflicts might occur and they are something very common within teams. It is important to understand that conflict among team members may undermine team cohesion and performance (McShane et al., 2018, p. 307). But what is team cohesion? It refers to the degree of attraction people feel toward the team and their motivation to remain members. It is a characteristic of the team, including the extent to which its members are attracted to the team, are committed to the team’s goals or tasks, and feel a collective sense of team pride (McShane et al., 2018, p. 227).
Team roles are important to be defined and this occurs during the forming stage, defining the roles is important to work efficiently, but we need to understand the meaning of a role first and it is a set of behaviours that people are expected to perform because they hold certain positions in a team and organization (McShane et al., 2018, p. 225).
Processes and Steps
After analyzing several groups and studying the development of humans in groups, their behaviour and interaction referred to the task activity, Tuckman defines four summarize stages knowing that this can be subject to further change due to them being a statement of data (Tuckman & Jensen, 2010), these stages are:
•	Forming is a period of testing and orientation in which members learn about each other and evaluate the benefits and costs of continued membership. People tend to be polite, will defer to authority, and try to find out what is expected of them and how they will fit into the team (McShane et al., 2018, p. 232). During this stage, several things occur, such as developing feelings like the excitement of being part of the team, and the behaviour of the team is a reflection of their excitement about the new team and the uncertainty or anxiety they might be feeling about their place on the team; lastly, team focus their energy in task development by creating clear goals, structure, direction and roles to begin creating trust within the team members (Stein, n.d).
•	Storming is a stage that is marked by interpersonal conflict as members become more proactive and compete for various team roles. Members try to establish norms of appropriate behaviour and performance standards (McShane et al., 2018, p. 233). During this stage, the team focuses on developing ideas; they develop feelings of frustration or anger with members or processes and members try to see how others handle conflict. This stage could be considered the less polite one due to frustration and disagreements. The team develops tasks to redefine the goals and conflict management (Stein, as cited in McShane et al., 2018).
•	Norming stage is where the team develops its first real sense of cohesion as roles are established and a consensus forms around group objectives and a common or complementary team-based mental model (McShane et al., 2018, p. 233). During this stage, the team develops an increased sense of comfort by expressing their ideas and feelings and constructive criticism for the team’s success, members are more conscious of the effort and achieve group harmony and they develop their language. The team focuses their energy on their goals and productivity (Stein, n.d).
•	Performing is where the team members have learned to efficiently coordinate and resolve conflicts. In high-performance teams, members are highly cooperative, have a high level of trust in each other, are committed to group objectives, and identify with the team (McShane et al., 2018, p. 233). During this stage, the team experiences a feeling of satisfaction and shares insights into personal and group processes, they feel attached to the team and feel confident they behave with a doing attitude and are more fluid among members they accomplish the tasks and celebrate the progress (Stein, as cited in McShane et al., 2018).
These four stages are the result of previous stages that Tuckman proposed as a model of development for various group settings over time, labelled (1) testing and dependence, (2) intragroup conflict, (3) development of group cohesion, and (4) functional role relatedness. The stages of task activity were labelled (1) orientation to task, (2) emotional response to task demands, (3) open exchange of relevant interpretations, and (4) emergence of solutions (Tuckman & Jensen, 2010).
After 12 years and some criticisms of the Tuckman model, he ran some reviews to examine published research on small-group development that would constitute an empirical test of Tuckman’s (1965) hypothesis that groups go through the previously mentioned four stages. As a result of these studies, a fifth stage, “adjourning,” was added to the hypothesis (Tuckman & Jensen, 2010).
Adjourning is the final stage that occurs when the team is about to disband. Team members shift their attention away from task orientation to a relationship focus (McShane et al., 2018, p. 233). During this last stage, the team feelings might be concerns and anxiety because of the uncertainty or future. At the same time feelings of satisfaction and mixed feelings. Morale might rise or fall in the ending stage. During this stage some members lose focus and reduce productivity and they focus the tasks in three sections – completion of deliverables, evaluation and closing ( Stein, as cited in McShane et al., 2018).
 
Strengths of the 5 Stages of Development
Bruce Tuckman’s theory of the five stages of development has been widely used in all aspects of educational and business paradigms. Each stage emphasizes commonly experienced behaviours that are consistently present in the group and team dynamics (Stein, as cited in McShane et al., 2018). In most professional circumstances there will be instances where employees will need to work together to complete a common goal or task. These situations can often be the cause of frustration, anxiety, and burnout for one or all members involved in the group (Mastering 5 Stages, n.d.). This is where Tuckman’s theory shows its strengths. Members of a flustered and frustrated group can look at the 5 stages and use the behaviours that they’re exhibiting or general feelings of the group to track their progress within the five stages. Tuckman’s use of identifying words such as coping, anticipation, dissatisfaction, and optimism gives members groups the tools to recognize their stage of development. They can begin working toward fixing any current issues or decide if they are ready to move on to the next stage of development (Roy, 2019). Along with the identifying factors in the five stages of development, Tuckman also offers group methods to reduce strain or tensions that have built up over time, highlighting the importance of strong group communication and following cohesion (Kobiruzzaman, 2019).
Weaknesses of the 5 Stages of Development
While it is a highly applicable theory of professional team development, Tuckman’s five stages of development have been criticized, recently, by scholars of Human Resource development. For instance, software delivery professional Doc Norton has stated that Tuckman’s theory does not work as well in practice as it does in theory. Norton quoted a 2007 study conducted by Monterey Naval Post-Graduate School in which researchers found that only two percent of teams who used Tuckman’s five stages of development completed all five stages upon completing the group goal (as cited in Knight, 2007). The issue, as reported by Norton, is that groups do not often follow the stages precisely and may be showing behaviours or doing tasks that can be associated with other stages (Alvares, 2019).
For instance, a group may be completing the task associated with the Norming stage of their group development and are ready to move into Performing. However, many members of the group may be feeling behaviours associated with the Storming stage. Teams need to recognize that no group will be perfect in their implementation of the five stages of development and 98 percent will not even complete all five stages (Knight, 2007). Another disadvantage to Tuckman’s theory is that it doesn’t offer any instant solutions to internal group issues, though it does go into varying detail about problems that may occur. It only guides teams through best-case scenarios (Kobiruzzaman, 2019). A final critique of Tuckman’s theory of the 5 stages of development is that there is no real solution for the communication strain that occurs during the Storming phase. This may leave groups vulnerable to never escaping the frustrating tension throughout the course of the team task (Kobiruzzaman, 2019).
Implications of Tuckman’s Model for Project Management Teams
The implication of Tuckman’s group development is essential for establishing a cohesive and productive project management team. Each stage relates to a project phase and establishes roles and mutual goals. Below, the theory is applied to the lifecycle of a project and the role of the project manager.
•	Stage 1: Forming is when the project management team meets, gets acquainted, and receives information about the project at hand. They go through the project charter and their roles within the team. The team leader must be clear in providing direction and establishing team norms during this stage (Abudi, 2015; Abudi, 2020).
•	Stage 2: Storming is unavoidable and often sees team members competing for recognition or conflicting over ideas and processes related to the project. This may be especially true for project management teams who are new to working with each other. Guidance and coaching from the team leader are essential for the team to progress through this stage. The project team leader must have strong conflict resolution and people management skills to successfully navigate this difficult stage. It is more likely for teams with professionally immature members to struggle with storming (Abudi, 2015; Abudi, 2020).
•	Stage 3: Norming is a time when the project management team works more cohesively towards their common goals. The leader can step back and allow each member to contribute per their specialization. The team members trust in one another more and become more productive as a team. The project manager’s role in this stage is to step in as needed, but to be overall less involved in the day-to-day tasks of the project (Abudi, 2015; Abudi, 2020).
•	Stage 4: Performing involves the team at its highest functioning and most motivated. The team has become very self-sufficient and relies less on the project manager for day-to-day guidance. However, the project manager still acts as the liaison between the team and the stakeholders, ensuring high-level decisions are being made and implemented (Abudi, 2015; Abudi, 2020).
•	Stage 5: Adjourning sees the completion of the project and the team relationships must move on to other avenues. Many team members, especially those in high-functioning teams, may feel lost and miss their team members. The project manager needs to ensure the team’s success is celebrated, as well as establish best practices for future projects based on the key learnings from the completed project (Abudi, 2015; Abudi 2020).

Managing Meetings
Effective meetings don't just happen, eh?
________________________________________
Managing meetings effectively in an IT project, especially when involving external resources, is crucial for ensuring productivity and alignment among all stakeholders. Here are some strategies to optimize your meeting management:
1. Define Clear Objectives
Before scheduling a meeting, clarify its purpose. Ask yourself if the meeting is necessary and what you aim to achieve. This helps in determining the agenda and the participants required. Meetings should focus on specific outcomes, such as resolving resource conflicts or discussing project timelines, rather than general updates that could be communicated via email [1].
2. Limit Meeting Frequency and Duration
Frequent and lengthy meetings can drain your team's productivity. Aim for minimal viable meetings—those that are essential for achieving your goals. Research indicates that meetings longer than 30 minutes tend to lose engagement, so strive to keep them concise and focused [1][3]. For complex projects, consider weekly meetings, but for less intensive projects, monthly meetings may suffice.
3. Prepare an Agenda
A well-structured agenda is vital for keeping meetings on track. Distribute the agenda in advance, allowing participants to prepare and contribute effectively. Prioritize agenda items based on urgency and importance, ensuring that critical issues are addressed first [1]. This approach not only saves time but also enhances engagement among participants.
4. Involve Key Stakeholders
When managing IT projects with external resources, it’s essential to include all relevant stakeholders in meetings. This includes team members, external partners, and clients. Their insights can provide valuable perspectives on project requirements and resource allocation. Engaging external resources early in the planning process can lead to better alignment and understanding of project goals [3].
5. Utilize Technology for Collaboration
Leverage collaboration tools to facilitate communication and document sharing among team members and external resources. Tools like Slack or project management software can help keep everyone informed and reduce the need for frequent meetings. Asynchronous communication can be particularly effective for updates that do not require real-time discussion [3].
6. Protect Team Time
Be mindful of your team's time and avoid scheduling unnecessary meetings. Assess whether the meeting is the best use of everyone’s time by asking if there’s a clear agenda and if all participants are essential. This practice helps in minimizing distractions and allows team members to focus on their core responsibilities [3].
7. Follow Up on Action Items
At the end of each meeting, summarize key takeaways and assign action items with clear deadlines. This ensures accountability and keeps everyone aligned on their responsibilities. Following up on these action items in subsequent meetings can help track progress and address any challenges that arise [1].
8. Foster a Culture of Feedback
Encourage participants to provide feedback on the meeting structure and content. This can help identify areas for improvement and make future meetings more effective. Regularly soliciting input from both internal and external resources can enhance collaboration and project outcomes [3].
By implementing these strategies, you can manage meetings in IT projects more effectively, ensuring that they contribute positively to project success rather than detracting from it.

•	Project Initiation
•	________________________________________
•	A project is initiated when a business need to build a system is identified, which can come from within a business unit, IT, a steering committee, or external consultants. Business needs may include supporting new marketing campaigns, reaching new customers, or improving supplier interactions. These needs can arise from organizational challenges like declining market share or from new business strategies. Organizations also monitor emerging technologies, allowing them to innovate and gain a competitive edge as first movers in the market.
•	The project sponsor, often from a business function or IT, champions the project and ensures it aligns with business goals. The size and scope of the project dictate the level of sponsorship required, from a single manager to the entire senior management team.
•	The business need drives the high-level requirements for the system, detailing what it should do. These requirements must be clear to ensure proper understanding by the approval committee and project team. The project sponsor also considers the system's business value, which can be tangible (e.g., cost reduction) or intangible (e.g., improved customer service). Once the business need, requirements, and value are identified, the project is formally initiated with a document called a system request.

Feasibility Analysis
Can we build it?
________________________________________
Feasibility analysis is a crucial step in the software development process that helps to evaluate the viability of a proposed system. It involves assessing whether the system can be implemented successfully in terms of technical, organizational, and economic aspects. For this class we are going to skip the economic considerations and just focus on technical and feasibility concerns. This matches the template described in the recommend textbook for this course.
Technical Feasibility
•	Familiarity with the functional (business) area: This refers to the understanding of the business domain for which the software is being developed. It’s important to have a deep understanding of the business processes, rules, and requirements to ensure the software meets the needs of the business.
•	Familiarity with the technical area: This involves knowledge and experience with the technologies that will be used to develop the software. This includes programming languages, databases, frameworks, and other tools. The more familiar the team is with the chosen technologies, the more likely the project is to succeed.
•	Complexity of the project: The size and complexity of the project can significantly impact its feasibility. Larger, more complex projects require more resources, time, and expertise. It’s important to assess whether the team has the necessary skills and resources to handle the project’s complexity.
•	Compatibility and integrations: The proposed system may need to integrate with existing systems or technologies. This could involve data exchange, user authentication, or other interactions. It’s important to assess whether these integrations are technically feasible and won’t introduce excessive complexity or risk.
Organizational Feasibility
•	Alignment with strategic goals: The proposed system should support the organization’s strategic goals. This could involve improving efficiency, reducing costs, increasing market share, or other objectives. A system that aligns with these goals is more likely to gain support and funding.
•	Potential project champions: Champions are individuals who support the project and can influence others to support it as well. They could be executives, managers, or other influential individuals within the organization. Identifying and engaging these champions can significantly increase the project’s chances of success.
•	Stakeholder acceptance: The proposed system will likely impact various stakeholders, including administrators, managers, and end-users. It’s important to assess whether these stakeholders are likely to accept and use the system. This could involve considering their needs, preferences, and resistance to change.
In conclusion, a feasibility analysis is a critical step in the software development process. It helps to identify potential challenges and risks, and assess whether the proposed system is likely to be successful. By considering technical and organizational factors, you can make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the project. Remember, a feasibility analysis is not a one-time activity but should be revisited throughout the project as conditions and assumptions change.
Ethical Considerations for Software Development
________________________________________
Software development is not just about writing code. It also involves making decisions that can have significant impacts on users, clients, and society as a whole. Therefore, it’s crucial to consider ethics in software development.
User Privacy and Data Protection
One of the most important ethical considerations in software development is user privacy and data protection. Developers should respect users’ rights to control their personal information. This includes collecting only necessary data, storing it securely, and using it only for its intended purpose. In addition, developers should be transparent about their data practices and provide users with clear, understandable privacy policies.
Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property rights are another key ethical issue. Software developers should respect the work of others by not using someone else’s code or ideas without permission. This includes respecting licenses, patents, and copyrights. In addition, developers should be aware of the potential legal and ethical implications of using open-source software.
Accessibility
Accessibility is an often-overlooked aspect of ethical software development. Developers should strive to make their software accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This can involve following accessibility standards, testing software with assistive technologies, and considering accessibility from the beginning of the development process.
Honesty and Transparency
Honesty and transparency are crucial in software development. Developers should be honest about their skills, the capabilities of their software, and any potential issues or limitations. They should also be transparent about their development processes and practices, including any decisions that could impact users or other stakeholders.
Sustainability
With the growing concern about the environmental impact of technology, sustainability has become an important ethical consideration in software development. Developers should strive to create software that is energy-efficient, uses resources responsibly, and can be maintained and updated over time without causing unnecessary waste.
In conclusion, ethics in software development involves a wide range of considerations, from user privacy and data protection to intellectual property rights, accessibility, honesty, transparency, and sustainability. By keeping these ethical considerations in mind, developers can create software that is not only functional and efficient but also respects users’ rights, contributes positively to society, and minimizes harm to the environment.
Ethical Considerations Regarding Health
________________________________________
Software development is a field that has far-reaching implications, not just in terms of technological advancements, but also in how it affects the health and well-being of its users. Ethical considerations are paramount in this context, as developers have a responsibility to ensure their products do not adversely affect the health of users.
Digital Well-being
One of the primary health-related ethical considerations in software development is digital well-being. This involves designing software in a way that promotes healthy usage patterns and discourages addictive behavior. For instance, incorporating features that remind users to take breaks or limit usage can help prevent issues like digital eye strain or tech addiction.
Physical Health
Software, especially in the realm of mobile applications, can have direct impacts on physical health. Developers need to consider how their software might encourage or discourage physical activity. For example, a fitness app should be designed to motivate healthy behaviors, while a gaming app might need features to remind users to take breaks for physical activity.
Mental Health
The impact of software on mental health is a growing concern. Ethical software development involves considering how software might affect users’ mental health and striving to minimize negative impacts. This could involve designing social media algorithms that don’t promote harmful content, or creating online platforms that prioritize respectful and positive interactions.
Accessibility
Accessibility is another crucial ethical consideration. Software should be designed to be usable by people with a wide range of abilities. This includes considering visual impairments, hearing impairments, and cognitive disabilities during the design process. Accessible design not only ensures equal access to technology, but it can also prevent health issues related to frustration or overexertion from trying to use inaccessible software.
Privacy and Stress
Privacy is a significant concern in the digital age, and breaches can lead to stress and anxiety for users. Ethical software development involves taking steps to protect user data and being transparent about data usage. This not only builds trust with users, but it can also prevent the stress associated with privacy concerns.
In conclusion, ethical considerations in software development extend to preventing adverse health impacts on users. By considering digital well-being, physical and mental health, accessibility, and privacy, developers can create software that not only serves its purpose but also promotes the health and well-being of its users.
The System Request
________________________________________
Project Sponsor Review
The project sponsor is the individual responsible for championing the system request. This person serves as the primary point of contact throughout the project's life cycle. They are often from a business function closely related to the system's purpose, such as marketing, finance, or IT. The sponsor advocates for the project, ensuring it aligns with the organization's goals and is appropriately prioritized. Their role also involves working closely with the project team and approval committee to ensure the system is developed and implemented successfully.
•	Example: The project sponsor for this initiative is the Director of Marketing, Jane Doe. Jane will serve as the primary contact throughout the project. With extensive experience in digital marketing, she recognizes the critical need for the new system to enhance campaign tracking and customer engagement. Jane will work closely with the project team to ensure the system meets marketing objectives and integrates smoothly with existing tools.
Business Need
The business need outlines the reasons for initiating the project. It highlights the specific issues or opportunities that the system is intended to address. Business needs can stem from various factors, such as improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer service, supporting new business strategies, or addressing competitive pressures. By clearly defining the business need, the system request ensures that the project is aligned with organizational goals and addresses a critical area of concern.
•	Example: The business need driving this project is the increasing difficulty in tracking the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns across multiple platforms. Currently, data is fragmented, leading to inefficient use of marketing resources and missed opportunities for targeted advertising. The system is needed to consolidate campaign data into a single platform, providing real-time analytics and improving decision-making.
Business Requirements
Business requirements specify the functionalities and capabilities the system must possess to meet the identified business need. These requirements describe what the system should be able to do, such as automating a process, providing real-time data, or enabling new customer interactions. Clearly defined business requirements help ensure that the system delivers the expected outcomes and that both the approval committee and project team have a shared understanding of the project’s goals. In a system request, we will only describe the most important requirements, and at a high-level (low detail). When creating software, there are many tiny requirements to consider, but we only begin to detail those after project approval.
•	Example: The system must include the following capabilities: 
1.	Campaign Management: Ability to create, track, and adjust marketing campaigns across various digital platforms (e.g., social media, email, search engines).
2.	Real-Time Analytics: Provide real-time reporting on campaign performance, including metrics such as click-through rates, conversions, and ROI.
3.	Integration: Seamlessly integrate with existing CRM and email marketing tools.
4.	User Access Control: Ensure that only authorized marketing staff have access to the system's different modules and data.
Business Value
The business value section of the system request describes the benefits that the organization should expect to gain from the system. These benefits can be tangible (easily measured), such as cost savings, revenue growth, or increased productivity, or intangible (harder to measure), such as improved customer satisfaction or enhanced competitive positioning. By articulating the expected business value, the system request justifies the investment in the project and provides a benchmark for measuring its success.
•	Example: The expected business value from this system includes:
•	
o	Tangible Value: 
	A projected 15% increase in campaign ROI due to better-targeted advertising and more efficient resource allocation.
	Expected to reduce manual reporting efforts by 25%, saving approximately $100,000 annually in labor costs.
o	Intangible Value: 
	Enhanced decision-making capabilities and improved cross-department collaboration will lead to a stronger competitive position in the market.
	The system will also boost customer satisfaction by enabling more personalized marketing efforts.
Special Issues or Constraints
Special issues or constraints refer to any additional considerations that could impact the project's outcome. These might include specific deadlines, regulatory requirements, resource limitations, or technological challenges. Special issues serve as a catch-all category for any information that might affect the project's success, ensuring that the project team and approval committee are aware of any potential hurdles or unique circumstances that need to be addressed.
•	Example: There are several special issues to consider:
•	
o	Deadline: The system must be fully operational before the launch of the company’s major holiday marketing campaign in November, giving the project a tight six-month timeline.
o	Regulatory Compliance: The system needs to comply with GDPR regulations, ensuring that all customer data is handled in accordance with privacy laws.
o	Resource Limitations: The project team has limited access to IT resources during the first three months due to other ongoing projects. This constraint must be managed to prevent delays.
The system request, once completed, is submitted to an approval committee, which could be a steering committee, senior executive, or another decision-making body. The committee reviews the request and determines whether to proceed with a feasibility analysis, which assesses the project's viability and potential impact on the organization.
While we've detailed this request and an approval process, it's important to acknowledge that each organization will conduct this process in it's own way which is likely to look different from what we are talking about here. Still, whatever their version of it looks like, it seeks to answer the same questions and provide similar insight with the goal of justifying the use of resources to pursue this solution.
Introduction to the SDLC
________________________________________
If you wish to make good quality software, you would be best to choose a reliable set of processes and practices to make it happen, track how it happened and learn from your successes or failures by the evidence you create by documenting it. This course will introduce you to traditional systems development methodologies, the continuing role of requirements documentation and the agile way of looking at things as well as basic use-case driven object-oriented development concepts.
The importance of knowing the content of this course cannot be understated, and it is only a mere glimpse into the much larger world of systems development waiting out there at your graduation. To know the content of this course is to know tried and trusted processes and practices that have influenced the vast majority of every piece of software you've ever used, but we could never teach you them all, because there are simply too many ways of doing things. It might be a bit unnerving then, that employers are expecting you to be able to jump into their organization and figure out their unique processes and practices quickly and get up to speed with your new team, and you are here to prepare for that. With this course, we hope that you gain a large amount of understanding into how your projects may or may not progress from beginning to end when working as a developer, or a DBA, or systems support, whatever it might be.
 
You wouldn't build a house without some manner of blueprint would you? Or something as highly complicated as a car, you wouldn't try to build one without at least a few engineering documents, right? We sure hope not. The fact is, there are thousands of software and IT projects that never reached their deliverables due to vague requirements, unclear directions and poor workflow management. Historically even those projects that do finish don't always do so in a way that truly meets the client's needs, or they are late, under featured or unstable, costing more than originally planned for. There is a myriad of things that can go wrong between the inception of an idea and actually seeing it through, just like any project. For that reason, development teams adhere to an agreed upon set of processes and procedures that guide how to get things done. It doesn't always require a blueprint, but what it does require every time is a methodology for creating quality systems. In this class we will explore these, but always remember, each development team has their own idea of what the best methodology is for them, and we are only trying to learn the common themes in these methods. There is no one-size-fits-all development method.
In that set of agreed upon guidelines a set of requirements should always come into being, and this is a major role of the systems analyst who essentially facilitates and coordinates much of the efforts to understand, define and articulate problems of the as-is system while working towards designing the to-be system. Poor analysis, communication or vague requirements can all result in disasters of varying magnitude. The idea here, is to have as few disasters as possible. Naturally with so many people involved in making a project happen, without clear expectations we can end up with just about anything, and we definitely do not want that: see cartoon below.
This course and your text are going to introduce you to the world of the analyst, which is the person who has to be able to conceptualize and envision the big picture, connecting all the pieces together and directing the way the project should be organized in order to meet the end goal of creating value for the client in the shortest amount of time and for the most reasonable amount of investment.
One of the key tools of any analyst role, is the SDLC. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to creating software applications. It encompasses a series of phases or stages that guide the development process from inception to deployment and maintenance. The goal of SDLC is to produce high-quality software that meets the requirements of the stakeholders while staying within budget and time constraints.
The Planning Phase
 
The Analysis Phase
 
The Design Phase
 
The Implementation (including Maintenance) Phase
 
________________________________________
 
SDLC - The Planning Phase
Why is this relevant to you right now?
On the topic of planning, you can immediately begin to implement some of the ideas from these lessons into your programming courses, and you should start figuring out how to do that as soon as possible. The whole point of being in college is to prepare for the workforce, and planning what you are about to do is an unavoidable step in the process of software development. Developers who do not plan well will rarely deliver acceptable quality results.
•	 Project Initiation - If you view each programming assignment you are given as a project initiation you can begin to understand what you need to do, and why, more clearly.
•	 System Request - A coding lab is essentially an incomplete system request. Whenever presented with a new assignment, try to complete a system request for it in an attempt to understand the assignment more clearly. This should help you to get to the end result more quickly.
•	 Feasibility Analysis - This part of planning is all about figuring out how capable are we of doing the work we've been assigned. You can use this analysis to reflect on how prepared you are for the programming assignment and perhaps identify more clearly what you need to do in order to be better prepared.
•	 Project Management - The topics in this course regarding project management are immediately relevant to your studies in programming, if you allow it to be. These concepts are without debate, absolutely essential to your success as a developer in the future. Either you'll be managed using similar principles, or (as in the case of many 3rd year alumni) end up managing teams yourself. Tasks, timelines and assigning human resources are all essential steps in managing groups of developers. So, any time you have group work you should be attempting to employ project management techniques to manage the group's effort. Avoiding doing so and hoping for the best is a consistent recipe for under-performing, or failing to achieve your goals.
________________________________________
The planning phase is all about considering the current system in place whether it is electronic or not, and determining why a new or updated system would be beneficial as well as how we could go about actually making it. There are two main steps in our traditional SDLC which result in a document known as a project plan, and they are the following.
Project Initiation - At this early state, someone (known as a project sponsor) has to justify why a new system is needed. That someone may identify a number of reasons why, such as increased productivity, a clear connection to profitability or outstanding issues of the current system that are hindering business in some way. 
It is rare for these ideas to come from the development group, and more often the need and suggestions come from other areas of an organization such as marketing, human resources, operations, accounting or whatever other departments there may be. Typically they express issues that they perceive a bit of IT work has the potential to remedy. Requests for this sort of work are most often delivered using a system request which essentially serves to describe the problem and how creating something to alleviate the problem would be beneficial to the business. Together with the sponsor, a development team undertakes creating a feasibility analysis to determine whether or not it's worth their time to pursue a solution, or how they may need to do it. 
The resulting documents are then presented to an approval committee who will consider whether or not to move ahead with the idea. Sometimes a good idea will get turned down though, or shuffled down the priority list, due to there being other projects currently underway that would be negatively impacted by the introduction of a new project, and so the committee is also tasked with ensuring the number and scope of projects underway within the business are not going to hinder one another in terms of consuming resources (time, money, people). So despite best efforts, you're brilliant request and analysis may just get shelved and it's important to recognize the probable business sense in that decision.

Project Management - Oh happy day! You're project has been approved and you are now set to forge ahead with fixing this problem. You've now entered the early stages of project management. At this point you need to come up with a tentative work plan to get the team moving, and for that you will have a project manager.
That manager starts arranging the initial team and how they will manage their workflow. The ultimate goal at this stage is to produce a viable project plan which details the tasks, resources, timelines and major deliverables of a project. Whatever your project plan says in the beginning, you can bet it will change once things get started as the project manager updates the plan to record how the work was actually completed as you go AND as new requirements become known and must be added in. So you should never finish a project with your project plan in exactly the same state it was the first day you made it.
An initial plan is a best guess before getting started, however, established development teams rarely start from scratch. Depending on the practices of the IT group, it's likely that they have completed many projects before, and so they should have many examples of successful or at least completed project plans at their disposal. The value in that, is they can look back to how long it took them to do certain things and what was involved in completing those things so that they can make informed estimates of how long it will take them to do the same or similar things now. We'll talk a little bit more about project plans in the near future.
SDLC - The Analysis Phase
Why is this relevant to you right now?
On the topic of analysis your success as a programmer will rely deeply on your ability to understand the situation you are being asked to create a solution for. Steps in analysis are all about understanding the problem at hand. In your programming courses you are being given problems, and step 1 is understanding the problem before attempting to piece together a solution. 
•	 Analysis Strategy - The analysis strategies covered later in the semester may not be directly applicable to your school work, but the principle of what they are does. You will need to develop an ability to analyze the situation so that you understand it, and once you understand it you are better positioned to solve it. Skipping analysis and jumping right into writing code more often than not results in time wasted, energy wasted, frustration, late submissions and in many cases attempts at plagiarism. It is better to avoid those pitfalls, and work on your ability to see clearly the problems in front of you.
•	 Requirements Determination & Gathering - On the other hand, requirements determination and gathering are absolutely essential to doing well in this program moving forward. This is particularly true for 2 and 3 year students, as in the coming semesters you will be given projects with vague requirements and it will be your job to question the professor in an attempt to determine the true scale of requirements for a project. The value of learning how to ask good questions cannot be overstated. It is a trait that sets fully capable, ready to rock developers apart from those who fumble their way through things and usually end up with poor results. Understanding the concepts of functional and non-functional requirements will make all of your coding labs easier to manage, and those concepts are unavoidable in industry. You can immediately being seeing them in your programming assignments. Every single assignment will have these requirements, although they may not be made clear to you, they are there. Learn how to see them, and you're abilities as a developer will grow faster than you expect.
•	 System Proposal - The system proposal is a document that essentially provides an overview of a system you want to create. In courses later in the program you will be required to analyze a situation, determine it's requirements and produce a system proposal before beginning to develop a fully functioning database application. In this class you need to learn what they are, and why they exist while also producing two of them yourself. This is to prepare you for those later courses where it is expected you know how to do it, and then later, in industry, the same expectation is there.
________________________________________
Imagine if you will that the approval committee came back and said "Hey, this is a great idea you've got here! We should definitely make this happen!" You and you're team are now given permission to really get going, so what's next? It is time to analyze the situation to determine exactly who will use this system, what your new or updated system will do, where it will be used and when. These details, brought together under a set of requirements documentation will clarify exactly what the development team needs to do. Defining requirements is easily one of the single most important aspects of system development, because without a strong blueprint you're going to build something useless and/or broken.
The analysis phase of the SDLC has 3 major steps:
Choose an Analysis Strategy - First your team will decide on an effective analysis strategy, which will serve as your systematic way of uncovering the requirements of the to-be system. This involves taking into consideration the existing system in order to clearly outline it's problems that a new system will alleviate. We will touch on a few strategies later on in the semester, for now it is just important to know that we strategically plan how we will learn about the existing system in a meticulous fashion.
Requirements Gathering - In this step we need to really ramp up the gathering of information on the as-is system and what specific individual problems the to-be system is going resolves. This part of the process involves a high degree of interaction with the client. If you are progressing with a traditional waterfall this will mostly happen in the beginning, but if you are working in an agile environment this will be regularly occurring. Either way, the point is to get as many details out of the client as possible about what they want. There are strategies for doing this and ways of documenting what we find, and we will touch on those things later this semester and repeatedly in the future.
System Proposal - At the end of all of these efforts we take our analysis about the system we intend to create and compile it into a report known as the System Proposal. This is the document to be reviewed by decision makers on whether or not this project will continue to move forward. This proposal contains details around all of the analyses, overall conceptual design of the system and all supporting models created via our requirements gathering efforts. This is the initial blue print of the project, like a baby blueprint. Although things often change, ultimately this document is meant to express the core idea behind the effort.
 

  

 
SDLC - The Design Phase
Why is this relevant to you right now?
On the topic of design, your programming labs require knowledge in this area to result in high quality as well. Designing is when we take our analysis and map it to a potential implementation. So after understanding the assignment you've been given, and before you go to write code you should do a little design work to plan exactly how you see your solution coming together.
•	 Design Strategy - This one is a bit more theoretical than other concepts in the course. That is because for your programming assignments you're only option to proceed with integrity is to develop it yourself. However, at higher levels of team management you will be faced with the decision options noted below and in your textbook, and they are pretty straightforward.
•	 Architecture Design - Every bit of software you write has limitations around what kind of system it will run on. Phone apps, linux servers, Windows desktop machines and laptops. Each of these have nuances in terms of coding, development environments and network connectivity. Every time you are given a programming assignment it will be worth pausing for a second and asking yourself questions about the system architecture that is required for whatever you are writing.
•	 Interface Design - UX, or User Experience, is incredibly important in software development today. Have you ever used an app, website or desktop application that just infuriated you when you tried to use it, or a specific feature in it? Yeah, me too. Every time you write a piece of software, no matter how small, it will benefit your professional development to consider how the user facing interface is organized, aligned, coloured and generally just presented to the user (your prof). Every time you make an interface, no matter how simple, think about the user who is actually using it. The sooner the get good at that, the sooner you'll be able to make interfaces that don't enrage people.
•	 Database and File Specifications - At this stage of your learning this is more "just so you know" than practical. However, in the coming semesters you will be required to choose a database system based on the requirements you've determined through a thorough analysis of the situation. It might not be relevant yet, but it will be soon.
•	 System Specification - Every programming lab you receive is in some way a system specification. In order to not confuse or overwhelm, we don't provide actual system specifications, but we do provide specifications. The requirements of the assignment are the specifications. Which language, which library to use, which functions/features, etc. Those are all specifications. When learning to program we have you look at just a small subset of specifications in order to focus your attention on a small handful of concepts. Later, as your ability as a developer expands those specifications also expand as does your responsibility for defining them yourself.
________________________________________
In the design phase we begin to very clearly articulate how the system will actually work by building off of the existing documentation we created. The earlier documentation effectively defines what we are trying to do, and to a large extent communicates how system needs to be arranged and oriented. But what those efforts have not revealed are the specifics of that implementation. Things such as the structure of the code itself, hardware, additional software, network requirements, the user interface including all forms, controls and reports and of course the database are all strategically decided upon, defined and then planned for integration in this phase. The design phase has 4 major steps:
Design Strategy - You basically get three options at this step and they set the stage for how the next steps and  the entire project will progress. This is a major pivotal moment in business decision making. Choosing the right design strategy falls to the options of buying an existing package of software that does what you need, developing the system in-house to utilize the talent already there or outsourcing the development to a firm that specializes in IT systems. There can also be mixing and matching of those options, and that's fine, but it needs to be figured out early on.
Architecture Design / Interface Design - As noted in your text, step 2 is all about determining the hardware, software and network infrastructure to be used in this system. Typically the to-be system is going to have to fit on whatever infrastructure already exists in the client's resources, rather than spend more money on implementing brand new environments which can be prohibitively expensive. This step also includes some preliminary interface design in terms of mocking up screen designs and navigational elements.
Database and File Specifications - This step focuses in on the data requirements of the project and defines what data needs to be stored in order to generate information, and where that data will be stored. This step on it's own can include the "database development life cycle" which is a development process entirely on it's own within the overall SDLC we are talking about. It is equally as thorough, but more about that comes next year in DBAS5206.
Program Design - The last step before deciding everything is ready to be legitimately created is the program design, which is basically defining the structure and processing of the software code that needs to be written to make this system happen. You can think of this as pseudo-code.
The system specification is born from these preceding pieces of documentation and it defines the information the coders need to know, so it is eventually sent off to the developers who will begin feverishly producing whatever the documentation tells them to. Before that occurs though, the state of the project typically goes through a review with an updated feasibility analysis and project plan. Now that you've come this far, it's important to review the situation and confirm it should proceed as we consider how things have progressed so far.
SDLC - The Implementation Phase
Why is this relevant to you right now?
On the topic of implementation, well, you're kind of always implementing right now, aren't you? Implementation is the writing of the code, installing the system and the maintaining of the system into the future. We're working to teach you how to code so that you can get the foundational skills sorted out. Eventually you will need to marry your ability to move through the SDLC with your ability to code. One leads into the other. They do not exist separate from one another.
•	 Construction - You are constantly constructing code at the moment. Little bite sized bits of code to demonstrate you understand something like, what an array is, and how to make use of it to solve simple requirements. Your entire time here in the program has you constructing small bits of code.
•	 Installation - Not until later will you need to actually install something you've written. So, this isn't happening terribly soon but it is important that you know the stream of events involved in implementing the system you have created. Actual implementation steps vary greatly from place to place, environment to environment. Being able to converse about it generally is the first step toward being trusted to do it practically.
•	 Support / Maintenance - This is probably the one piece of this course that truly is theory for you. That is because the support and maintenance of software is the longest part of the life cycle. You might spend 1-yr writing a piece of software, but you'll spend 10-15+ years supporting it by fixing it up, improving it's performance and adding new features. So, not necessarily immediately relevant, but relevant. Know it.
________________________________________
Everybody's favourite part has finally arrived, implementation! Where we can stop worrying about making documents and just make a system (ha, you wish)! Let's just make one thing clear, some people split this final stage up into two stages, but we don't. Some folks make a whole new phase known as "Maintenance", but in the world of SYDE2203 this is included as a part of implementation. Just another example of how one organization can see things a little different from another.
This is essentially the final phase, and if everything goes to plan this will be where the majority of time and effort is spent over the life span of the system. This is when the system is actually built, the hardware is sourced and configured, the code begins to actually be written, tested and interfaced with other parts of the system. All of the hard work of uncovering requirements, documenting what was needed and then planning how to meet those needs comes to fruition here. In a nutshell, the implementation phase has 3 major steps:
Construction - This is the first step of this phase and is moment the coders fingers start hitting the keyboard to build the system to the specifications. In this step as the system is being built it is also being tested to ensure it meets all of the requirements of the project. Testing is absolutely essential as we build, as an unnoticed bug can go on to cost millions or more in damages to a business (ever seen Office Space?). Some operations perform testing periodically, shipping off chunks of code to dedicated teams to try to break and report back. Other development teams however do things a little backwards, in that before writing any code they actually write tests first which helps to clarify exactly the functionality they need to create. Other still, wait until the very end for testing which is extremely risky and we do not suggest doing this. More on this, later in the semester.
Installation - Once we are confident in our constructed system, the time comes to deliver by installing it for the client. This process usually takes place in one of two ways. There is either a sudden shutting down of the old system, which is then immediately replaced by the new system (changing over a production system in a factory overnight). Or, where permitted and as often as possible, the new system is slowly released a little bit at a time to an organization just in case something goes wrong (eg. managing databases of people, services or goods). If something does go wrong the client can continue to work and event revert any updated parts of the system to a working state while issues are worked out of the system to-be. This is usually the safer way to do things. Along with this installation by the way, comes the need to develop training materials, but you don't have to worry about that until year 3.
Support / Maintenance - The most expensive and lengthy phase of any system implementation, it is now that we establish how this system needs to be supported including bug fixes, updates, new features and continued training support. As long as the system is in use, this phase is active and may require mini-projects following the same SDLC to implement changes later on.
Introduction to Development Approaches
________________________________________
Generally speaking, most problems tend to have more than one solution, and each of those solutions probably has it's own unique set of steps to follow in order to reach implementation. Step 1, Step 2, Step 3... problem solved!
In the realm of software development our job is to design and create solutions to business problems, and like most problems, each IT project has a ton of possible solutions. For each one of those solutions, there is a different way of going about completing them. In industry terms what we are thinking about are called development approaches, and they will very likely come to define the way in which you work and interact with other team members throughout your career, regardless of which approach it is, there will be one for you to adhere to. So let's get going...
Choosing a Development Approach
Are you thinking a this point "Gee, this sure is a theoretical class!" It's not, like not at all. You are in coding courses right now, and the principles we are covering in this course can almost entirely be applied to getting your homework done in those classes. The SDLC can happen for each of your coding or testing labs. First you need to review the requirements of the assignment (planning & analysis) so that you understand the problem you're dealing with, including asking the professor for clarification. Then you can move on to using your brain to think through what your solution should be doing, and how (design). After you've got a solution in mind, you begin writing the code to make it happen (implementation). So, there are very practical reason why this course is in this semester. It's meant to help you see how people in the industry get work done in time for you to practice using similar techniques to get your school work done. Practice makes perfect, right?
Waterfall Methodology

The Waterfall methodology is one of the earliest and most traditional approaches to software development. It follows a linear and sequential progression of phases, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.
The typical phases of the Waterfall model include:
1.	Requirements Gathering: In this initial phase, the project requirements are gathered and documented. This phase involves extensive communication with stakeholders to define the scope of the project.
2.	System Design: The system architecture and design are developed based on the gathered requirements. This phase outlines the overall structure and functionality of the software.
3.	Implementation (Coding): The actual coding of the software takes place in this phase. Developers write the source code based on the design specifications.
4.	Testing: After the code is complete, thorough testing is performed to identify and rectify any defects or issues. This ensures that the software functions as intended.
5.	Deployment: Once the testing phase is successful, the software is deployed to the production environment for end-users to access and utilize.
6.	Maintenance: This phase involves ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to the software as needed.
No matter which method you end up choosing, every organization, manager or team has their own interpretation of the "right" way to go about it. Consider the explanation in the following video. Where does it align and/or differ from the points above?
•	*Video about prototyping*
•	*Video about agile development*
•	*Video about extreme programming* 
Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC)
________________________________________
The Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) is a set of processes and activities that organizations follow to ensure that their software is developed with security in mind. The goal of the SSDLC is to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities and threats in the software development process, so that the final product is as secure as possible.
Here are the key phases of the SSDLC:
1.	Requirements Gathering: This is the initial phase where the requirements of the software are collected and analyzed. In the context of SSDLC, this would also include identifying security requirements based on the nature of the software and the data it will handle.
2.	Design: In this phase, the software system is designed. Security considerations are integral to this phase, and the design should ensure that the architecture will be secure.
3.	Development: This is the phase where the actual coding happens. Developers need to be cognizant of potential security concerns at each step of the process. This requires integrating security into your SDLC in ways that were not needed before.
4.	Testing: In the testing phase, the software is tested for functionality, performance, and security. Security testing should be conducted at this stage to identify and fix any security vulnerabilities1.
5.	Deployment: During deployment, the software is made available for use. It’s important to ensure that the deployment process itself is secure, to prevent any security vulnerabilities from being introduced at this stage.
6.	Maintenance: After the software has been deployed, it needs to be maintained and updated regularly. This includes updating the software to patch any security vulnerabilities that are discovered, and making changes to improve security as needed.
Incorporating security throughout the development process helps to catch issues in requirements before they manifest as security problems in production. With dedicated effort and the right security solutions, security issues can be addressed in the SDLC pipeline well before deployment to production.
